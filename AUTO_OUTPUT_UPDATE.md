# SuperCombobox CPE Auto-Output Update

## Summary
Updated the superComboboxCPE component to properly implement Flow Builder's auto-output functionality for the initialSelectedValue field.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced `loadFlowVariables()` method in superComboboxCPE.js
- Added support for `automaticOutputVariables` from `builderContext`
- Now displays output variables from other components in the flow
- Includes both regular flow variables and automatic outputs from previous components
- Added proper labeling to distinguish between regular variables and outputs from other components
- Implemented duplicate prevention using a Set to track processed variables
- Added alphabetical sorting of variables (keeping --None-- at the top)

### 2. Updated HTML template
- Changed placeholder text from "Select a String variable" to "Select a String variable or output"
- Updated help text to clarify that users can select outputs from previous SuperCombobox components

### 3. Enhanced debug logging
- Added logging for `automaticOutputVariables` in the builderContext setter
- Added count of automatic output variables for debugging purposes

## Technical Details

The CPE now checks multiple sources for available variables:
1. **Regular Flow Variables**: From `builderContext.variables`
2. **Automatic Output Variables**: From `builderContext.automaticOutputVariables` 
3. **Element Outputs**: From `builderContext.elementInfos` (as a fallback)

Variables are displayed in the format:
- Regular variables: `{!variableName}`
- Output variables: `{!variableName} (from ComponentName)`
- Element outputs: `{!elementApiName.outputName} (output)`

## Testing

A test flow `Test_SuperCombobox_AutoOutput.flow-meta.xml` has been created that demonstrates:
1. First screen with a SuperCombobox for Account Type selection
2. Second screen with a SuperCombobox for Account Rating that can reference the output from the first
3. Display screen showing both selected values

## Usage

When configuring the SuperCombobox component in Flow Builder:
1. The "Initial Selected Value" field now shows all available String variables and outputs
2. Select an output from a previous SuperCombobox component to pre-populate the value
3. The component will automatically show the correct value based on the previous selection

This enables chaining of SuperCombobox components where later selections can be influenced by earlier ones.
